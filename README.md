# 🏨 Lakh Hostel

**Lakh Hostel** is a modern, responsive hostel booking and information website designed to provide users with an intuitive way to explore hostel facilities, check room availability, and learn about services.  
This project focuses on a clean UI, mobile responsiveness, and a user-friendly experience.

This is my 2nd-year, 3rd-semester internal assessment project for Web Development. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, showcasing fundamental front-end development skills including responsive design, interactive elements, and clean UI implementation.
